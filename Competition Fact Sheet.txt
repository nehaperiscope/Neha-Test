Calling all Data Professionals! We’re excited to announce our first-ever community competition. You don’t have to already be a Periscope user, and you don’t need to know Python or R. Everyone is welcome!


The Challenge: 
Using Kaggle’s dataset on UFO sightings, create an eye-catching and informative data visualization of your choice. Submissions will be split into three categories: 
1. Visualizations using Python
2. Visualizations using R
3. Visualizations using SQL only


A panel of qualified judges will select 1 winner for each category.


Prizes: 
Winners will have the option to select any of the following prizes:
1. A hiring-manager interview for the open Business Operations and Analytics Manager role at Periscope Data
2. An Amazon gift card
3. Periscope Data Swag


Winners will also be featured in the Periscope Data Blog
